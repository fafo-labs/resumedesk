<br/>

An open-source resume builder that helps you create professional resumes with ease. Originally conceived as a SaaS product, now available for free to the community.

## Why ResumeDesk?

Professional and formal resumes are often created using LaTeX due to its superior typesetting capabilities and clean, structured output. However, the learning curve for LaTeX can be steep for many users. ResumeDesk bridges this gap by providing LaTeX-quality professional resumes through an intuitive, user-friendly interface - no LaTeX knowledge required.

## üîç Important Note

You might notice traces of authentication and payment-related code in the repository. This is because ResumeDesk was initially developed as a paid SaaS product. However, we've decided to make it completely open source and free for everyone to use. While some of these features are still present in the codebase, they are not active in the current version.
